                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">Where to Stay</h3>
                <p>
                    Zarzis has a good choice of budget and middle class hotels which offer comfort rather than luxury. There are some three star hotels in the town centre and more at the aforementioned tourist zone a few kilometres north, right on the beach. Odyssee Resort
                    Thalasso & Spa Oriental, Sangho Hotel, Oamarit hotel, Zephir and hotel Zita are the most popular options.
                </p>
                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">Restaurant</h3>
                <p> There are plenty of good places to eat Zarzis, from cheap snacks to good upmarket restaurants.
                </p>
                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">Climate in Zarzis</h3>
                <p>
                    Zarzis has a good climate for tourism all year round. The Mediterranean climate gives long hot summers tempered by the sea breezes, and mild showery winters. Average temperatures are 23C (73F) in April and 33C (92F) in August.
                </p>
                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">Currency</h3>
                <p>
                    There are plenty of banks, ATMs and currency exchange facilities in the larger tourist hotels.
                </p>
                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">Transport</h3>
                <p>
                    Getting around the town is easy on foot. Use local buses or shared taxis (louages) to explore the nearby coastal villages.

                <p>Djerba or Jerba is an island of paradoxes. In itself it is a fairly large island, just off the North African coast, which has almost no other islands along it. And it’s a tourist resort, a big one, with plenty of wide open spaces for effortless
                    living. It’s easy to access as there is a narrow causeway linking it to the mainland at El Kantara.
                </p>
                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">Fortress</h3>
                <p>
                    Borj el-Kebir, sometimes called Borj Ghazi Mustapha, has had many rulers over the years. It was a Roman building and was the first recorded stronghold here, but it was the king of Sicily, Roger de Loria, who in 1289 built the very first fortress here.
                </p>
                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">Aerobics on the Beach</h3>
                <p>
                    You will notice that the majority of the tourists on Jerba are German. They fill up the touristic zone of Jerba, and the canny small vendors and hustlers down here address you first in German, before they try their halting French. Listen out for the standard
                    opening sentences: “Wie geht’s?”, “Eine Frage bitte”. Unfortunately the touristic zone which has such potential to be the base and starting point for some lazy and pleasurable explorations of the island, seems to have turned into a
                    tourist ghetto. Every hotel comes with at least one restaurant, bar and discotheque, as well as ‘animators’, people that have actually gone to school for a couple of years to learn how to amuse charter tourists. Fake Tunisian folklore,
                    jokes and aerobics on the beach seem to have been dominating their curriculum and the true culture of Jerba is lost.
                </p>
                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">Golf at Jerba</h3>
                <p>
                    In a place as historic as Jerba this loss of Tunisian culture is sad. Great things are so close, so easy to get to, and people are very friendly. So, even if the beaches are great and you have a good time, these mindless types of holidays on Jerba are
                    really a waste and you could be anywhere in the world.

                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">Ouled el-Hadef</h3>
                <p>
                    Ouled el-Hadef clearly has one of the most impressive desert quarters in Tunisia. This area is almost unchanged over the centuries, and some of the houses are from the 14th century. The house and decoration style is even older.
                </p>
                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">Doors and interiors</h3>
                <p>
                    Blue decorated door / White decorated door .. Tozeur is one of the best places in Tunisia to go door spotting. Styles vary a lot, and many doors are unique to this part of the country. Note the 2 or 3 door knockers. The number reflects the family structure,
                    but explanations vary. One says that the third knockers is added to the door when the family has its first child, or its first son. The other explanation says that the right knocker is for the men of the house, the left for the women
                    and the lower for the children. According to this explanation, each knocker gives a different sound, the male knocker the deepest

                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">Marabout of Sidi Aguili</h3>
                <p>
                    There is nothing special, historical or religiously, about the Marabout of Sidi Aguili. But its setting is ideal, right where where a water canal enters the oasis gardens, and with plenty of flower bushes in front. It is among the most popular postcard
                    motifs from Tozeur.
                </p>
                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">Shopping quarters</h3>
                <p>
                    The shopping quarters of Tozeur are among Tunisia’s most attractive. Streets are made up traditional Tozeur houses, and exhibits are very colourful.

                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">The Medina</h3>
                <p>
                    It may seem small now but during its heyday Madhia was the Fatimid capital or North Africa and the successful home base that led to the conquest of Cairo which then ultimately led to the cities demise as Cairo took over as the capital of the Fatimid empire.
                    In 916AD, Obeid Allah, the Fatimid Caliph started what would be the Golden era of Mahdia until 947AD. However, Mahdia was a rich regional city until the 14th century.

                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">Borj El-Kabir</h3>
                <p>
                    The BIG fort is well named as it is just that a lovely imposing solid fort that in contrast to Monastir where the Ribat was added to over time, the fort remains a clean example of the 16th century structure. At the time of writing March 2009 the entry
                    fee for the fort was 4 dinars +1 dinar for bringing a camera which is ok for foreigners but expensive for Tunisians. I hate the camera charge especially as these days photos are free advertising on social media and internet!

                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">The Graveyard Next to the Sea</h3>
                <p>
                    My unexpected highlight of Mahdia was not the gate or the fort but the beautiful and disorganized graveyard that rolls across the entire tip of the Peninsular. Not only does that graveyard have a wonderful first line view of the sea but is also has a
                    road winding through it and also has both the ruins of the old city defenses, a Fatimids port and a nice lighthouse.
                </p>
                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">The Fatimid Port and Defences</h3>
                <p>
                    In the graveyard, there is a perfectly formed little port which is still in use by the local fisherman. It may not be as protected as it once was, but you can clearly see the ability of the Fatimids to cut out a port in the peninsular and also cut a channel
                    in from the sea.
                </p>
                <h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo 2', cursive;font-size: 25px;color: black;">The Red Lighthouse</h3>
                <p>
                    The final attraction on the peninsular is the lighthouse at the end which is famous for its Red tower
